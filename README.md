# mapbrainiac

Hi! My name is Levente, I am 13 years old and I am absolutely fascinated with Geography, and Coding.
So I thought, "I should make a website which allows users to learn about a specific city or country which they would like to learn about"
And here I am at Coolest Projects 2023 presenting "MapBrainiac" which is a website (TBA) that is accessed freely by all users.
Currently, I am mainly working on implementing all the capitals of Europe, but in the near future I will add all major cities around the globe.
I will also be adding a 'Quiz' option which will let the user quiz themselves based on the information that was shown about that city/country.
